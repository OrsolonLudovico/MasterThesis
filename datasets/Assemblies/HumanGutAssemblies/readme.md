# Human Gut assemblies
I provided a `.slurm` [script](./downloadHumanGut10000.slurm) which tries to download up to 10000 human gut files of various years from the *NCBI* website. In the end there aren't enough files so it just downloads all aviable ones.

- Number of files:  
  - 3396     
- Size:  
  - 129 GB

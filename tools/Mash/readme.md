# How did I use Mash? 
I ran Mash two times: once on the compressed dataset and once on the uncompressed one, each run gave me a `.txt` file. I later compared the two files as detailed in the [Analysis](./Analysis) folder.

# Example on how mash works
I ran the Mash using .slurm files like the one provided [here](./run_Mash_comp.slurm). This example is the run on the compressed dataset about the Human gut reads.

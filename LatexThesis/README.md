This is a basic but functional latex template to write a thesis for your degree at UNIPD.  

The pdf file produced will be a PDF/A-3b (you can verify it [here](https://demo.verapdf.org)), and it will adhere to the requirements by UNIPD on thesis upload  

Feel free to open issues if you wish to have features added.

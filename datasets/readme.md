# About the datasets
I used two types of datasets: datasets containing assemblied genomes and datasets containing reads. 
Using USTAR on the assemblies provided only a small compression due to the fact that the process of assembling a genome removes most of the redundancies. On the other hand compressing a dataset of reads yelded much better results due to the inherit repetitiveness of the reads.

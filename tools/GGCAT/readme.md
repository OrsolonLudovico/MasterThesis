# How did I use GGCAT?
I ran the program on the uncompressed and compressed version of each dataset separately, obtaining a graph for each one. 

# Example on how GGCAT works
The `.slurm` [file](./GGCAT_compressed_gut.slurm) is an example of a run of GGCAT on the compressed version of the *Human Gut reads* dataset.  
I performed some analysis in the [Analysis](./Analysis/) folder.

# How did I compare the results?

I used the [python file](./compare_tables.py) to compare the tables recived as output from the compressed and uncompressed datasets. I also needed some libraries for python and I decided to store them in a singularity image file (.sif). That container is build using the specified `.def` [file](./mash_analysis.def).

# How did I use Mash? 
I ran Mash two times: once on the compressed dataset and once on the uncompressed one, each run gave me a .txt file. I later compared the two files as detailed in the [Analysis](./Analysis) folder.

# Exampre on how mash works
blablabla

# Report and explain a slurm file that runs mash

# My master thesis (change this when we know the name)

This is the repository where I'll store and explain my work towards the master thesis.

# What's my thesis about?

Briefly: I used a tool called [USTAR](https://github.com/enricorox/USTAR) to compress genome datasets and evaluated how well this compression works in tandem with various tools.

## How?

Using Singularity and a computing cluster. For more information, look into the dedicated section: [Singularity](./Singularity).
